### Important Commands
1. Start by cloning repository
2. Change directory to **cs35l-project-react-app**
3. Run essential npm commands
    - ```npm install``` (installs all dependencies listed in package.json)
        - To install packages individually:
        - ```npm install --save firebase```
        - ```npm install --save react-router-dom```
    - ```npm start```

When adding a new node package to the project, make sure to install the package with the --save option (e.g. ```npm install --save NEWPACKAGE```). This will allow other contributors to simply run ```npm install``` next time they merge your changes, without having to install each package and its correct version one-by-one.

### Git Commands For Reference
- ```git clone```: Use to clone repository at start
- ```git remote add origin https://github.com/armaan-abraham/cs35L-final-project```: Creates remote repository to contribute to
- ```git branch *branchname*```: Create branch to work on
- ```git checkout```: Switch to branch 
- ```git add```: Add files and changes before commiting
- ```git commit -m "What you did"```
- ```git push origin *branchname*```: Push changes to remote repository
* Only push code that compiles and runs

### Other Notes
- Always log any new commands or installations other members may need to run the code properly
